### How Confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
* I feel pretty good about Arrays so far, but do have more questions about using Boolean data types (*see below*). I have a good understanding of each of the vocabulary terms, and am working on using those terms when discussing the content.

### Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
* I would like to spend some more time going through the [Array doc](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.2/Array.html#method-i-insert) to try different methods. Would like to practice some of the methods by predicting the output and then seeing what happens using `irb`.

### What questions do you have about Arrays?
* I would like to see how you would use a Boolean Array in a program. I was not sure how to declare a variable storing an Array of Booleans. I simply listed `own_dogs = [true, true, false, true, false]`. I can understand using Boolean to equal true **or** false for one variable, but don't understand how this would work in an Array (ie. `variables = [true, false, true, true]`).
